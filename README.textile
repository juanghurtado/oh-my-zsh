A handful of functions, auto-complete helpers, and stuff that makes you shout...

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

h2. Setup

@oh-my-zsh@ should work with any recent release of "zsh":http://www.zsh.org/, the minimum recommended version is 4.3.9.

1. Clone the repository

  @git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh@

2. Create a new zsh config by copying the zsh template we've provided.

  *NOTE*: If you already have a ~/.zshrc file, you should back it up. @cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig@ in case you want to go back to your original settings.

  @cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc@

3. Set zsh as your default shell:

  @chsh -s /bin/zsh@

4. Start / restart zsh (open a new terminal is easy enough...)

h3. Problems?

You _might_ need to modify your PATH in ~/.zshrc if you're not able to find some commands after switching to _Oh My Zsh_.

h2. Usage

* enable the plugins you want in your @~/.zshrc@ (take a look at @plugins/@ to see what's possible)
** example: @plugins=(git osx ruby)@
* Theme support: Change the @ZSH_THEME@ environment variable in @~/.zshrc@.
** Take a look at the "current themes":https://wiki.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/themes that come bundled with _Oh My Zsh_.
* much much more...  take a look at @lib/@ what _Oh My Zsh_ offers...

h2. Useful

the "refcard":http://www.bash2zsh.com/zsh_refcard/refcard.pdf is pretty tasty for tips.

h3. Customization

If you have many functions which go good together you can put them as a *.plugin.zsh file in the @custom/plugins/@ directory and then enable this plugin.

h2. Help out!

I'm far from being a zsh-expert and suspect there are many ways to improve. If you have ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!

h2. Contributors

This project wouldn't exist without all of our awesome users and contributors.
